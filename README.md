## TODO:
- Test with different people's schedule
- Include Date that classes start and finish

## Development Branch
This is the development branch. Before I push this one live, it needs to be tested with more data from the laurier api.

### Version 2.0
The reason I swapped from taking data from LORIS to taking data form students.wlu.ca is that the LORIS source included personal information. By moving to the students.wlu.ca api, it's made the process a lot safer.
